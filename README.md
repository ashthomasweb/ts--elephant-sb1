This version is currently under refactor to Typescript, with Context and Reducer patterns.

A Single Page Application imitating a 'sticky note' board. Users can create a login access and retrieve previously constructed and saved boards. 
<!-- 
Elephant Chart features user customization of separate color schemes for notes and backgrounds for each unique board. 'Mat' function allows a container to be placed behind the user's notes, aiding in organization within one board.
